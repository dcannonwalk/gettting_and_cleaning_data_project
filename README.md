Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
==========================================

This repository hosts the R script file and documentation for the Data Science Specialization course "Getting and Cleaning data" for coursera.

The dataset that is being used is: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Files Description

The code takes for granted all the data is present in the same directory, uncompressed and no names are changed.

`CodeBook.md` summarizes the variables and operations that was performed on those variables to clean up the data.

`run_analysis.R` contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 sections/steps.

The output of the 5th step is called `tidyData.txt`, and is uploaded with the rest of the files.
